        (optional) The configuration to use. By default your Scheme
        defines which configuration (Debug, Release, ...) should be used,
        but you can overwrite it with this option.
        **Make sure that the Configuration you specify actually exists
        in your Xcode Project**. If it does not, if you have a typo
        in the value of this input Xcode will simply use the Configuration
        specified by the Scheme and will silently ignore this parameter!

        __DEPRECATED!__ 

        Use `force_code_sign_identity` and `force_provisioning_profile` instead.
        
        If set to "yes" then it'll use the `PROVISIONING_PROFILE` (set
        to the value of the `$BITRISE_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_ID` environment)
        and `CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY` (set to the value
        of the `$BITRISE_CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY` environment)
        Xcode Command Line parameters,
        for force the use of specified Certificate and Provisioning Profile,
        to the ones
      value_options:
        - "yes"
        - "no"
      is_required: true
  - force_code_sign_identity:
    opts:
      title: "Force code signing with Identity"
      description: |-
        Force xcodebuild to use specified Code Sign Identity.

        Specify code sign identity as full ID (e.g. `Mac Developer: Bitrise Bot (VV2J4SV8V4)`)
        or specify code sign group ( `Mac Developer` or `Mac Distribution` ).

        You also have to **specify the Identity in the format it's stored in Xcode project settings**,
        and **not how it's presented in the Xcode.app GUI**!
        **Capitalization also matters**, `Mac Distribution` works but `mac distribution` does not!
  - force_provisioning_profile:
    opts:
      title: "Force code signing with Provisioning Profile"
      description: |-
        Force xcodebuild to use specified Provisioning Profile.

        Use Provisioning Profile's UUID, profile's name is not acceptable by xcodebuild.

        How to get your UUID:

        - In xcode select your project -> Build Settings -> Code Signing
        - Select the desired Provisioning Profile, then scroll down in profile list and click on Other...
        - The popup will show your profile's UUID.

        Format example:

        - c5be4123-1234-4f9d-9843-0d9be985a068
  - export_options_path:

      title: "Export options path"
      description: |-
        Specifies a path to a plist file that configures archive exporting.
        If not specified, it will generate an export options plist with the method specified in `export_method`.
        Call xcodebuild -help for available export options.
  - export_method: "development"
    opts:
      title: "Export method"
      description: |-
        The method for exporting used in `exportOptions` plist.
        `none` means no resigning during export.
        Upload and install proper certificates when exporting with different identity than the one used for archive.
        See `xcodebuild -help` for more information.

        If this input is set to `yes` step will collect every dsym (.app dsym and framwork dsyms) in a directory, zip it and export the zipped directory path.
        Otherwise only .app dsym will be zipped and the zip path exported.
